    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>"Hull electors," declared a Radical contemporary, "have
    dealt the Coalition a stinging rebuke." But not, as others
    claim, the <i>coupon de grace</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>&Agrave; propos</i>, a Woking butcher was fined last week
    for being thirty-two thousand coupons short. The report that he
    has since received a letter of condolence from Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
    is not confirmed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A correspondent who has a latchkey would like to hear from a
    gentleman who could fit a house to it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A food inspector at Chatham admitted that he could not tell
    the difference between No. 1 grade tinned beef and No. 2 grade.
    The old plan of calling one grade Rover and the other Fido
    seems to have been abolished since the War.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The EX-CROWN PRINCE, in a recent interview with a Danish
    newspaper man, called LUDENDORFF a liar. LUDENDORFF is believed
    to be preparing a crushing rejoinder, in which he calls the
    EX-CROWN PRINCE a Hohenzollern.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The new Bolsheviks," says <i>The Philatelist</i>, "are
    fetching eight shillings a pair." It doesn't say where they are
    fetching it from, but it is clear that he loot business has
    declined since the days of the old Bolsheviks.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The United States Government has purchased four million
    pounds of frozen chickens for the American army. They are to be
    tested by inspectors before shipment to determine whether they
    are edible. What is known in scientific circles as the Soho
    standard of resilience will probably be applied.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Burglars have broken into an East End moneylender's office.
    It is not known definitely how much they lost.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The five hundred pounds in notes recently lost by a London
    hotel guest have now been recovered. It appears that a waiter
    had mistaken them for a gratuity.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Metropolitan police are trying to establish the identity
    of a man who can give no account of himself and who knows
    nothing about the War. The fact that he was not wearing red
    tabs only adds to the mystery.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Some men dance the Jazz dance," says a contemporary,
    "because it is stimulating." It is not known why the others do
    it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A squirrel having been stolen from the Zoo, it is said that
    the authorities are taking no further risks, and that in future
    all lions and tigers will be securely chained to their
    cages.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is reported that a much-advertised motor-car, after
    having its engine removed, ran for seven miles on its
    reputation alone.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>With reference to the report that a service man had received
    a letter from the Intelligence Department admitting that a
    certain mistake was due to a clerical error, it is now reported
    that this admission was due to another oversight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A terrible tragedy was only just averted last week, when a
    husband, who had travelled from the City by tube, and his wife,
    who had been to the Spring bargain sales, failed to recognise
    each other on their return home.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The War Office, the Board of Trade and the Zoo have formed a
    Triple Alliance for a campaign against rats. As a result of
    this it is said that quite a number of the more timid rodents
    are afraid to go out alone after dark.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Society of Public Analysts has been asked by the Food
    Ministry to define a sausage. A number of pedigree sausages are
    to be submitted for classification.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs in the late Bavarian Soviet
    Government has been placed in a lunatic asylum. The reason for
    this invidious distinction is not assigned.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Mr. CHURCHILL on the Hull Election:</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Nothing in these reactions should be taken by the
        Government as in any way deflecting them from their clear
        and definite course of reviving the posterity of this
        country."&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>All very well, but they must get it born first.</p>

    <h2>THE SPOIL-SPORT.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Phillybag was demobilised. The Day had come. For months
    he had dreamed of the possibility&mdash;had imagined the joy
    and alacrity with which he would doff his cap, tunic and
    trousers, service dress, one each, and resume the decent
    broadcloth of a successful City solicitor. Strangely enough,
    however, once he was actually demobilised he found himself in
    no hurry to lose the garb which showed that he, Mr. Phillybag,
    had helped, you know, to put the kybosh on the KAISER. He was
    proud too of the corporal's stripes which he had gained in a
    very short Army career.</p>

    <p>That explains why he was in uniform this morning in his
    office, when he opened a letter from Ernest Williams, his
    former junior clerk. He remembered Williams well&mdash;how in
    the early days of the War that youth had seen Lord KITCHENER
    point his finger from the hoardings at him, and there and then,
    discovering that the Ordnance Department possessed a cap, size
    6-7/8, which fitted him, had followed instructions and
    immediately commenced to wear it. Now he had written to Mr.
    Phillybag to inform him that, as he expected to be demobilised
    shortly, he was calling at eleven o'clock to discuss the
    question of re-entering his employ.</p>

    <p>Mr. Phillybag rubbed his hands together in satisfaction. He
    was looking forward to the interview. Since Armistice Day he
    had read every article he could find written on the subject of
    demobilisation and its humours; consequently he knew exactly
    what he was expected to do. When Williams entered, in all the
    glory of a Captain's stars, perhaps even a Major's crown, the
    ribbon of the D.S.O. or the M.C., or both, on his breast, he,
    Corporal Phillybag, would spring smartly to attention, salute
    and address his junior clerk as "Sir."</p>

    <p>He chuckled with delight as he visualised the piquant scene.
    Reseating himself, he would briskly resume his interrupted work
    for a moment while be kept his superior officer waiting.
    Then&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mr. Williams to see you, Sir," said one of his clerks.</p>

    <p>"Show him in at once."</p>

    <p>On his appearance Mr. Phillybag suffered a slight recoil,
    but recovered himself quickly and exchanged embarrassed
    greetings. An awkward pause followed. At length Mr. Phillybag
    broke it.</p>

    <p>"Williams," he said severely, "I'm surprised at you. Who
    ever heard of an employee returning to civil life from the Army
    with a lower rank than the one his employer holds? Four years
    in khaki and only a lance-corporal! You've spoiled my whole
    morning. It's men with careers like yours who make the
    profession of humorous journalism so precarious."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>A SOUVENIR OF COLOGNE.</h2>

    <p>"Am I really awake, or is it all a beautiful dream?" I said,
    pinching myself to make sure.</p>

    <p>At the other end of the room an unmistakably German band was
    playing "Roses of Picardy," while all around me German waiters
    were running about deferentially, with trays in their hands.
    Even as I wondered one of them approached and laid the bill on
    my table with a friendly smile and "Tree mark, bleesir."</p>

    <p>Then I remembered that I was at the British Officers' Club
    in Cologne.</p>

    <p>"How interested they will be at home," I thought, "when they
    know where I am. And of course I must send them souvenirs of my
    Watch on the Rhine;" and thoughtfully I produced from my pocket
    some local tram-tickets, kept for the younger members of the
    family, and patted a box of two-penny cigars encouragingly.
    These I was going to send to my brother.</p>

    <p>Then I rose and, paying the bill, went out to purchase a
    suitable memento for a younger sister. Slowly I wandered along
    the crowded Hohestrasse in the direction of the Opera House,
    peering into the shop-windows for something redolent of the
    land I was in. Presently a bright-looking sweetshop attracted
    me. The window contained a beautiful selection of
    chocolate-boxes, with pictures of the Cathedral or the Rhine
    Maidens on the lids. In I went and selected a handsome sample,
    bound with red plush and bordered with sea-shells. But it was
    empty. "Nix sweets," said the girl behind the counter, and
    offered me the alternative of a bun. Nothing doing, and I
    passed on.</p>

    <p>Further along the street I stopped before a chemist's shop
    to regard a huge pyramid of bottles of eau-de-Cologne displayed
    in the window.</p>

    <p>"The very thing," I said to myself. "What more appropriate
    souvenir than a bottle of the local produce?"</p>

    <p>That was ten days ago, and this morning I received the
    following letter:&mdash;.</p>

    <p>"Thank you <i>so</i> much for the scent; it was sweet of
    you, and arrived safely, only I don't think it <i>quite</i> so
    nice as the <i>real</i> eau-de-Cologne which I buy at Brown's
    shop [Brown is the village grocer] for three-and-nine a bottle.
    And he says they must have taken you in properly with a German
    imitation called eau-de-<i>K&ouml;ln</i>, and expects you had
    to pay a pretty penny for it, though I hope you didn't, poor
    boy."</p>

    <h2>THE BLUE HAT.</h2>

    <p>Nancy came softly into my study and stood at the side of the
    desk, where I was busy with some work on account of which I had
    stayed away from the office that morning.</p>

    <p>"Do you like it?" she said.</p>

    <p>I felt a momentary anxiety as I looked up. I had made a bad
    mistake only a little time before, having waxed enthusiastic
    over what I took to be a new blouse when it was a question of
    hair-dressing, the blouse having been worn by my wife, so she
    solemnly averred, "every evening for the last two months."</p>

    <p>But this time no mistake was possible. You don't go about
    the house at eleven o'clock on a cold Spring morning fancifully
    arrayed in a pale blue hat with white feathery things sticking
    out all round it, unless there is a particular reason for so
    doing.</p>

    <p>"I think it's a delightful hat," I said, "and suits you
    splendidly. But I thought you never wore blue?"</p>

    <p>"I don't," said Nancy; "that's what makes me rather
    doubtful. I didn't really mean to buy it at all. I went in to
    Marguerite's&mdash;you know, that heavenly shop at the corner
    of the square"&mdash;I nodded; of course I knew
    Marguerite's&mdash;"to ask the price of a jade-green jumper
    they had in the window&mdash;oh, my dear, a perfect angel of a
    jumper!&mdash;and they showed me this. That red-haired
    assistant almost <i>made</i> me buy it; said she had never seen
    me in a hat that suited me so well; and really it wasn't so
    very dear. But I <i>was</i> a little doubtful.
    However&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"She was quite right," I said very decidedly. "Did you get
    the what-you-may-call-it&mdash;the other thing?"</p>

    <p>Nancy's face expressed poignant anguish.</p>

    <p>"Twelve guineas," she said. "I simply couldn't run to it. Of
    course I was heart-broken. Still, it wasn't as if I really
    needed anything just now. It would have been ridiculous
    extravagance. But it really was an angel."</p>

    <p>She turned to go, stopping a moment on the way out to have
    another look at herself in the little round mirror over the
    mantel-piece.</p>

    <p>"I'm not quite happy about it," I heard her murmur as she
    went out.</p>

    <p>The next morning I found a letter waiting for me at the
    office which brought me news of a totally unexpected windfall
    of some fifty odd pounds. It was a sunny morning, too, with a
    distinct feeling of Spring in the air.</p>

    <p>I felt like being extravagant, and my mind flew at once to
    Nancy and her jade-green&mdash;what was the name of the
    thing?&mdash;that she had wanted so badly.</p>

    <p>I left the office early, and on my way home managed to
    summon up sufficient courage to carry me through the discreetly
    curtained doors of Madame Marguerite's <i>recherch&eacute;</i>
    establishment, devoutly hoping that the nervous sinking which I
    felt about my heart was not reflected in my outer
    demeanour.</p>

    <p>The red-haired girl, in spite of a curiously detached and
    supercilious air, as who should say, "Take it or leave it; it
    concerns me not in the least," which at first rather alarmed
    me, was really quite kind and helpful.</p>

    <p>"Something in jade-green that Moddom admired? A hat
    perhaps?"</p>

    <p>No, I knew it was not a hat. I murmured something about
    twelve guineas. This seemed to be enlightening.</p>

    <p>Ah, yes, a jumper probably. They had had a jade-green jumper
    at that price, she believed. If I would sit down for a moment
    she would send someone to see if it were still
    unsold.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317"
       id="page317"></a>[pg 317]</span>

    <p>I felt very anxious while I waited, but the emissary
    presently returned with the garment over her arm.</p>

    <p>Yes, that was undoubtedly the one. She remembered how much
    Moddom had admired it. It had suited Moddom so well too.</p>

    <p>While it was being packed up, for I decided to take it with
    me, a small boy arrived with several hat-boxes, which he put
    down on the floor.</p>

    <p>Red-hair proceeded to unpack them, carefully, almost
    reverently, extracting the hats from the folds of surrounding
    tissue-paper and placing them one by one in various cupboards
    and drawers. Presently she drew forth from one of the
    boxes&mdash;I felt sure I was not mistaken&mdash;that very blue
    hat which I had admired only the day before upon the head of my
    wife.</p>

    <p>I gave an involuntary exclamation. Red-hair looked at
    me.</p>

    <p>"Surely," I said, feeling inwardly rather proud at
    recognising it again&mdash;"surely that hat is exactly like one
    that my wife bought yesterday."</p>

    <p>Red-hair was hurt. "It is the same hat," she said coldly.
    "We never make two models alike."</p>

    <p>I tried to mollify her. "I can't understand her sending it
    back," I said. "I think it's an extremely pretty hat, and it
    suits her so well. But perhaps there was some alteration
    necessary. It may not have quite fitted or something?"</p>

    <p>Red-head dived gracefully into the box and drew forth a note
    from the tissue-paper billows.</p>

    <p>A faint flicker expressive of I knew not what hidden emotion
    seemed to pass for one moment over her aristocratic features as
    she read it. But it vanished instantaneously, and she turned to
    me with her previous air of haughty and imperturbable
    aloofness.</p>

    <p>"Moddom is not keeping the hat," she said.</p>

    <p>I felt somehow a little snubbed, and said no more, and, my
    parcel appearing at this moment, I paid and departed.</p>

    <p>Nancy's joy over the jumper more than came up to my
    expectations. When she had calmed down a little I bethought
    myself of the matter of the hat.</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes," said Nancy in reply to my question, "I sent it
    back after all. It won't matter in the least now that you have
    bought this."</p>

    <p>"But why didn't you keep it?" I said.</p>

    <p>"Well, I really felt I didn't like it so very much," said
    Nancy, "and, as you didn't seem quite to like it
    either&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"My dear girl," I protested, "I told you I thought it was
    charming."</p>

    <p>"Well, anyway you said that blue didn't suit me," persisted
    my wife. "You <i>did</i>, George."</p>

    <p>There was a moment's pause. It was no use saying anything.
    Suddenly Nancy jumped up and clutched me by the arm.</p>

    <p>"George," she said anxiously, "you didn't, you didn't say
    anything about that hat to the girl in the shop, did you?"</p>

    <p>"I believe I mentioned that I thought it was extremely
    pretty, and that I was sorry you weren't keeping it," I replied
    airily. "But why?" For my wife's face had suddenly assumed an
    expression of horrified dismay.</p>

    <p>"I shall never be able to go into that shop again," she
    wailed, "never. I wrote them a note saying that I was not
    keeping the hat because <i>my husband very much disliked
    it</i>, and that I didn't care ever to wear anything of which
    he didn't approve."</p>

    <p>What is really very unfair about the whole thing is that I
    know that Nancy thinks me entirely to blame. Indeed she told me
    so. When I ventured to point out that she had not been quite
    truthful in the matter she was at first genuinely and honestly
    amazed, and subsequently so indignant that I was fain
    ultimately to apologise.</p>

    <p>In looking back upon the episode I am filled with admiration
    for the red-haired girl. I consider that she showed
    extraordinary self-restraint in what must have been a
    peculiarly tempting situation.</p>

    <h2>SMALL-TALK.</h2>

    <p>"Of course you must come," said Mary; "it's nonsense to say
    you can't dance."</p>

    <p>Mary is married to my first cousin, Thomas. I looked at
    Thomas, but saw no hope of support. Thomas labours under the
    delusion that he can jazz.</p>

    <p>"It isn't only the dancing," I protested; "it's the
    conversational strain. Besides, as one of the original founders
    of the League to Minimise Gossip amongst General Staff
    Officers&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Rot!" said Thomas; "you simply let your partners do the
    talking. You needn't even listen. Just say 'Quite' in your most
    official tone whenever you hear them saying nothing."</p>

    <p>Thomas, although my first cousin, is not bright; but I had
    to go.</p>

    <p>For the first few dances I escaped; the crowd round the door
    was so dense that I saw at once that I should be trampled to
    death if I attempted to enter. Then I was caught by Mary and
    introduced to a total stranger.</p>

    <p>I suppose there are people who do not mind kicking a total
    stranger round the room to the strain of cymbals, a motor siren
    and a frying-pan. I fancy the lady expressed a desire to stop,
    but as her words were lost in the orchestral pandemonium I
    realised that as long as the dulcet chords continued
    conversation was impossible; so we danced on.</p>

    <p>Fortunately too, when the interval came, she was full of
    small-talk.</p>

    <p>"Isn't the floor good? And I always like this band."</p>

    <p>"Quite," said I.</p>

    <p>"Rather sporting of the Smythe-Joneses to give a dance."</p>

    <p>"Quite," said I.</p>

    <p>"Especially when their eldest boy, the one, you know, who
    was so frightfully good at golf or something, has just got into
    a mess with&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Quite," said I, while she plunged into a flood of
    reminiscences. She did not ask whether I could jazz, mainly, I
    think, because I had already danced with her. I concentrated my
    thoughts on the best means of avoiding Mary when the music
    began again, and just threw in an occasional "Quite" to keep
    the lady in a good temper.</p>

    <p>But there was no escaping Mary.</p>

    <p>"You <i>must</i> go and dance with Miss Carter," she told
    me, adducing incontrovertible arguments. I am terrified of Miss
    Carter, who can only be described as "statuesque" and always
    does the right thing (which makes her crushing to the verge of
    discourtesy). I am always being asked if I know whether she is
    "only twenty-two." It was not without satisfaction that I
    initiated her into my style of dancing.</p>

    <p>To my horror, when we stopped she sat in silence, regarding
    me with an air of expectant boredom. I racked my brains.</p>

    <p>"Good floor, isn't it?" said I.</p>

    <p>"Quite," said Miss Carter.</p>

    <p>"Jolly good band too."</p>

    <p>"Quite," said Miss Carter.</p>

    <p>"And rather sporting of the Smythe-Joneses, don't you
    think?"</p>

    <p>She said it again. By this time I felt convinced that all
    the other couples within hearing were listening to us. Miss
    Carter is that sort of person.</p>

    <p>"Of course," I said with a nervous laugh, "it's rather
    absurd for me to say anything about it, because, you know,
    dancing isn't much in my line."</p>

    <p>"Quite," said Miss Carter.</p>

    <p>That settled it; I felt I must stop her at all costs. I
    cleared my throat and spoke as distinctly as I could.</p>

    <p>"I'm always being asked a conundrum, Miss Carter, and you're
    the one person who can tell me the true answer. Am I permitted
    to ask it?"</p>

    <p>"Quite," said Miss Carter, for the first time almost
    smiling. I plucked up courage.</p>

    <p>"It's this: how old are you?"</p>

    <p>She stopped herself just in time. Her answer was given in a
    tone which expressed at the same time her contempt for my
    breach of the conventions and the fact that she was too
    indifferent to think me worth snubbing.</p>

    <p>"Twenty-two," said she.</p>

    <p>"Quite," said I.</p>

    <h2>THE CAREER (POSTPONED).</h2>

    <p>MY DEAR JAMES,&mdash;A few weeks ago I wrote to tell you
    that ere long the military machine would be able to spare one
    of its cogs&mdash;myself. I discussed possible careers in civil
    life, and since then I had almost decided on "filbert-grower."
    Had things gone well, by the beginning of June you should have
    received a first instalment of forced filberts.</p>

    <p>Now this cannot be. The cog is shown to be indispensable. I
    must remain a soldier.</p>

    <p>Why do they want me, James? I am nothing like a soldier. I
    cannot click my heels as other men do. I try, Heaven knows how
    I try, but all the C.O. hears is a sound as of two cabbages
    being slapped together. And my word of command! The critics say
    it is like a cry for help in a London fog.</p>

    <p>My haversack contains no trace of any Field-Marshal's baton.
    You are aware that every private soldier's haversack is issued
    complete with "Batons, one, Field-Marshal (potential), for the
    use of." But there is no authority for such an issue for
    commissioned ranks.</p>

    <p>Is it because of my manner with men and my powers as a
    disciplinarian? I fear not. If a man is brought before me for
    summary jurisdiction a lump rises in my throat and I want to
    cry. I am always sure he didn't mean to do it. As for military
    law, I am shaky on the fines for drunkenness, and I don't feel
    at all sure whether death at dawn or two extra fatigues is the
    maximum punishment for having one string of the hold-all longer
    than the other when on active service.</p>

    <p>When I kicked the bell-push towards the end of last
    guest-night the Adjutant said he should mark me down for the
    job of Physical Training Officer; but I hope he was only
    joking. I am not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"
       id="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span> built for the work. My
       frame is puny and my countenance irresolute. I hate bending
       and stretching my arms; they creak and frighten me. I never
       could squat on my heels like a thingummy.</p>

    <p>I might, if allowed, make a hit as Messing Officer. With the
    aid of my Cookery Course notes I can differentiate between no
    fewer than thirty-four different types of rissole.
    Unfortunately we already have a Messing Officer of deadly
    efficiency. He can classify dripping by instinct. He can
    memorise at sight all the revolting contents of a swill-tub. My
    rissole lore is a poor asset in comparison.</p>

    <p>No, James, I think I have it. One day you will read that our
    Armies of Occupation consist of so many hundred thousands of
    all ranks, including, perhaps, 35,001 officers. That is why
    they retain me. I shall be the "1" at the end of the thousands.
    It is your humble servant's function to keep the Armies of
    Occupation up to strength.</p>

    <p>Are we to be robbed of the fruits of victory? The reply is
    in the negative. Therefore, when next June comes along and you
    yearn for the early filberts, do not be fretty. Remember that I
    am gathering in fruits of another and a nobler kind. Yours
    ever,</p>

    <p>WILLIAM.</p>

    <h3>BEING SOME LETTERS OF MRS. PARTINGTON TO HER SISTER.</h3>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[Conferences between mistresses and servants are being
        held in various parts of the country to discuss terms of

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Puddleford</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MOIRA,&mdash;We haven't got a servant yet, but we are
    clutching at a new hope. There is to be a conference here
    between mistresses and maids, to discuss and readjust the
    servants' rights and the mistresses' wrongs&mdash;or is it the
    other way about? Anyhow, I shall attend that conference. I
    shall bribe, plead, consent to any arrangement if I can but net
    a cook-general. Ten months of doing my own washing-up has
    brought me to my knees, while Harry says the performance of
    menial duties has crushed his spirit.</p>

    <p>Of course, Harry does make such a fuss of things. You might
    think, to hear him talk, that the getting up of coal, lighting
    fires, chopping wood and cleaning flues was the entire work of
    a household, instead of being mere incidents in the daily
    routine. If he had to tackle <i>my</i> duties&mdash;but men
    never seem to understand how much there is to do in a
    house.</p>

    <p>I will tell you about the conference when I write again.</p>

    <p>Yours always, DODO.</p>

    <p><i>Puddleford</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MOIRA,&mdash;The conference was a most interesting
    affair; the one going on in Paris could never be half so
    thrilling. There was a goodly attendance of servants, and they
    had their own spokeswoman. We spoke for ourselves&mdash;those
    of us who were not too dazed at the sight of so many
    "treasures" almost within our grasp.</p>

    <p>What the servants wanted was not unreasonable. They chiefly
    demanded a certain time to themselves during the day, with
    fixed hours for meals, evening free, etc.</p>

    <p>Then Mrs. Boydon-Spoute got up&mdash;you know how that woman
    loves to hear herself talk&mdash;and said that such demands
    were outrageous. (It's easy for her to raise objections. She
    has somehow paralysed her two servants into staying with her
    for over ten years.) She pointed out that under such conditions
    the servant would have more freedom than the mistress; and to
    allow the working classes to thus get the upper hand was
    nothing short of encouraging Bolshevism in the home. Dreadful
    thing to say, wasn't it?</p>

    <p>The servants got rather restive at that. When I thought of
    the two days' washing-up waiting for me at home I retorted with
    spirit that servants had as much right to freedom as we, and it
    was our duty to guard their interests&mdash;and lots of
    inspired things like that, glaring at Mrs. Boydon-Spoute the
    while.</p>

    <p>I spoke so well that a cook-general offered herself to me as
    soon as the conference was over. She comes in on Monday.</p>

    <p>Yours in transports, DODO.</p>

    <p><i>Puddleford</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MOIRA,&mdash;Emma, the new maid, has arrived. Harry is
    as relieved as I am and was quite cheerful while I was dressing
    the gash he had inflicted on his hand while chopping wood.
    Isn't it strange that men can never give the slightest
    assistance in the house without getting themselves hurt in some
    way?</p>

    <p>Emma promises to be a treasure. If mistresses would only
    show a little humanity there never would be any servant trouble
    at all. It is people like Mrs. Boydon-Spoute who are
    responsible for it.</p>

    <p>Yours, purring content, DODO.</p>

    <p><i>Puddleford.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MOIRA,&mdash;I am sorry not to have written for such a
    long time. I have been so extremely busy.</p>

    <p>You see, when Emma has had her two hours free daily, her
    hour-and-a-half off for dinner, with half-an-hour for other
    meals, every evening out as well as two afternoons a week, you
    would be surprised what little leisure is left to her for the
    housework.</p>

    <p>She gets in what she can, of course, and I do the rest.
    Doing the rest, by the way, takes up a great deal of my time.
    But I generally have an hour free in the evenings.</p>

    <p>Your brave DODO.</p>

    <p><i>Puddleford</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MOIRA,&mdash;I am glad to say Emma has gone and I am
    putting my name down at a registry-office in the usual way.
    It's too much of a strain having "conference" girls in the
    home.</p>

    <p>Who was it said that if we are to allow the working classes
    to get the upper hand it was nothing short of encouraging
    Bolshevism in the home? Anyhow, I think he&mdash;or perhaps it
    was she&mdash;must be right.</p>

    <p>I must close rather hastily. I have just heard a terrific
    crash in the kitchen; I'm afraid Harry has dropped something on
    his foot <i>again</i>.</p>

    <p>Your long-suffering DODO.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, April 14th</i>.&mdash;The Criminal Injuries
    (Ireland) Bill furnished the LORD CHANCELLOR with the text for
    a rather gloomy sermon on the present state of the
    sister-country. The King's Writ still runs there, but in many
    counties is outstripped by the rival <i>fiat</i> of Sinn Fein.
    A tribute to the impeccable behaviour of "law-abiding" Ulster
    appeared to stir in the breast of Lord CREWE memories of the
    pre-war prancings of a certain "Galloper," for he remarked that
    the noble lord's information seemed to be "partial and
    recent."</p>

    <p>Exception has recently been taken to the cab-shelter in
    Palace Yard, some Members objecting that its architectural
    design was out of harmony with that of the Houses of
    Parliament, and others complaining that its internal
    attractions were so great as to seduce the taxi-men from paying
    any attention to prospective fares. Sir ALFRED MOND, after long
    consideration, has decided to abolish the offending edifice and
    to give the drivers a shelter in the Vaults, where the police
    will discourage them from exceeding in the matter of "rest and
    refreshment."</p>

    <p>Members were naturally eager to hear what Mr. BONAR LAW,
    freshly flown from Paris, had to tell them about the Peace
    Conference, the prospects of hanging the EX-KAISER, and so
    forth, but received little information, save that the
    Government shared the popular desire that no legal quibble
    should prevent the arch-criminal being brought to justice.
    Members were a little comforted, however, by the announcement
    that a Committee of the Cabinet is already considering the
    whole question of Peace-celebrations. While Mr. LLOYD GEORGE is
    engaged (if the image is permitted) in fighting beasts at
    Ephesus it is pleasant to think of his colleagues deciding upon
    the relative merits of crackers and Catherine-wheels, flares
    and bonfires, church-bells and steam-sirens, as means for the
    expression of the national joy.</p>

    <p>After the loud orgy of headline which followed upon his
    remarkable victory at Central Hull, Commander KENWORTHY might
    reasonably have expected that his entry into the House would
    have produced an uproarious scene of demonstration and
    counter-demonstration. But there was nothing of the kind. The
    jubilant "Wee Frees," of course, cheered as one man, but the
    volume of sound produced was not appreciably greater than if
    one man had cheered; and the crowded Coalitionists sat gloomily
    silent, though no doubt they thought a lot. The gallant
    Commander has already introduced one pleasing innovation into
    the procedure of the House, for, before signing the Roll, he
    nodded cheerfully to the ladies in the Gallery, as if to say,
    "But for you I shouldn't be here!"</p>

    <p>Sir A. GRIFFITH-BOSCAWEN, who at Question-time had
    regretfully admitted that the Government were withdrawing
    soldiers from agriculture at a moment when they were
    particularly required, now moved the Second Reading of the Bill
    which is intended to give them the chance of going back to the
    land in perpetuity. In spite of his warning that the cost of
    the land to be acquired was a comparatively minor part of the
    expense, Members vied with one another in denouncing the
    iniquity of allowing the land-owner to get the present
    market-value of his property; and the landlords'
    representatives themselves hastened to declare that such a
    preposterous notion never entered their heads. The Bill was
    read a second time without a division. I don't suppose it will
    provide land for anything approaching the eight hundred
    thousand soldiers who are said to be pining for it; but it
    ought to satisfy the relatively small proportion who, after
    hearing about the trials and hardships of a
    small-holder&mdash;no forty-eight hours' week for
    him!&mdash;retain their agricultural aspirations.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, April 15th</i>.&mdash;In a couple of hours the
    Lords disposed of several Bills, enjoyed a scientific debate on
    neurasthenia&mdash;described by a correspondent of Lord
    KNUTSFORD as "a gas escaping from people"&mdash;discussed the
    prices of milk and cheese, and still found time for the
    consideration of their own procedure. Lord CURZON said the
    suggestion that the House should sit on more days in the week
    had not been favourably received. Friday would not do, as their
    Lordships went out of town on that day, and Monday was equally
    inconvenient, as they could not contrive to get back by then.
    To earlier sittings the LORD CHANCELLOR objected on behalf of
    his legal colleagues. So it looks as if there would be no
    change, and since, <i>teste</i> Lord SALISBURY, the House does
    its work admirably, why should there be?</p>

    <p>Remembering a famous speech on the presumption of certain
    organs of the Press, the Commons were not surprised to learn
    from Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the beer-tax,
    that he is not responsible for what may appear in <i>The
    Times</i>.</p>

    <p>There is still something of "the eternal boy" in Major
    WEDGWOOD BENN. It was with an air of "Now I've got him" that he
    propounded the question, "Is paper a raw material or a
    manufactured article?" But Mr. BRIDGEMAN can always solve these
    Cobdenite conundrums, and quietly replied, "Both." Whereupon
    Major BENN, with an engaging blush, retired from the fray.</p>

    <p>In moving the second reading of the Aliens Restriction Bill
    the HOME SECRETARY said that, while national safety must be the
    first consideration, no unnecessary hardship should be
    inflicted on our foreign immigrants. But his proposal that the
    Government should rest contented with its present powers for
    another two years met with little favour from Members whose
    knowledge of history seems to date from 1914. In the opinion of
    Mr. BOTTOMLEY, who led the Opposition, every alien was <i>prima
    facie</i> undesirable; Sir ERNEST WILD, from his experience in
    the criminal courts, took the same view, and patriotically
    demanded the exclusion from our shores of persons whose
    principal occupation, we gathered, was to furnish him with
    briefs for the defence; and Mr. JOYNSON HICKS, Mr. BILLING and
    Sir R. COOPER urged that the SHORTT way with aliens should be
    made considerably shorter. Before this massed attack the HOME
    SECRETARY gave way and agreed to reduce the operation of the
    Bill to one year.</p>

    <p>The temperature of the House rose so appreciably during the
    debate as to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"
       id="page326"></a>[pg 326]</span> upset the nerves of some of
       the ladies in the Strangers' Gallery. At least that is the
       charitable explanation of the behaviour of Miss SYLVIA
       PANKHURST and her friends, who interrupted a discussion on
       soldiers' pensions by shouting out, "You are a gang of
       murderers!"</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 16th</i>.&mdash;A crowded House, the
    Peers' Gallery full to overflowing, the HEIR-APPARENT over the
    Clock, and the new Editor of <i>The Times</i> among the
    representatives of the Press&mdash;the PRIME MINISTER could
    have desired no better setting for his speech upon the labours
    of the Peace Conference. His original intention was to hold his
    forces in reserve and invite his critics to "fire first," but,
    as none of these gentlemen seemed to be particularly anxious to
    go "over the top," Mr. LLOYD GEOEGE obligingly altered his
    battle-plan and himself delivered the opening fusillade.</p>

    <p>That he was in no apologetic mood was shown in almost his
    first sentence. His declaration that indemnities were a
    difficult problem, "not to be settled by telegram," evoked
    resounding cheers. Thenceforward he held the sympathy of the
    House, whether he was describing the difficulties of the Peace
    Conference, or reconciling the apparent inconsistencies of its
    Russian policy, or inveighing against the attempts of certain
    newspapers to sow dissension among the Allies. "I would rather
    have a good Peace than a good Press" was one of his most
    telling phrases, and it was followed by a character-sketch of
    his principal newspaper-critic which in pungency left nothing
    to be desired. "What a journalist I could have made of him!"
    the recluse of Fontainebleau will doubtless remark when he
    reads the passage.</p>

    <p>The PRIME MINISTER'S object, I imagine, was less to impart
    information than to create an atmosphere; and he was so far
    successful that the House showed little inclination to listen
    to other speakers. Nevertheless several of them devoted some
    hours to saying nothing in particular before the House
    mercifully adjourned for the Easter Recess.</p>

    <h2>FROM THE STREET OF ADVENTURE.</h2>

    <p>Journalistic reconstructions and amalgamations have been
    proceeding so rapidly and extensively of late that there seems
    no end to the kaleidoscopic possibilities of the future.</p>

    <p>Up to the present, however, no confirmation can be obtained
    of the startling rumor that <i>The Spectator</i> has been
    purchased by the proprietors of <i>The Kennel Gazette</i>, and
    will henceforth be devoted to the interests of our four-footed
    friends, the supplements being restricted to purely feline
    amenities.</p>

    <p>Another persistent rumour, which hitherto lacks the seal of
    official corroboration, is to the effect that <i>The
    Guardian</i> is to be given a new range of activity as the
    organ of scientific spiritualism, under the title of <i>The
    Guardian Angel</i> and the joint editorship of Sir Oliver Doyle
    and Sir Conan Lodge. The investigations into multiple
    consciousness conducted by these two eminent <i>savants</i>
    have proved their mutual convertibility to such an extent that
    they have decided upon this rearrangement of their names. If
    the scheme materialises the stimulating collaboration of Mr.
    HAROLD BEGBIE is a foregone conclusion, and there is even a
    possibility of contributions from an August Exile somewhere in
    Holland.</p>

    <p>A third report maintains with minute circumstantiality that
    the proprietors of <i>The Economist</i>, having come to the
    conclusion that this journal needs brightening, have decided to
    entrust the post of principal leader-writer to "CALLISTHENES,"
    and retain the services of the authoress of <i>The Tunnel</i>
    as financial <i>feuilleton</i> writer. But on enquiry at the
    London School of Economics we could not obtain any definite
    information.</p>

    <p>The rumours that <i>The Morning Post</i> is about to be
    merged in <i>The Winning Post</i>, and that Mr. MAXSE is
    starting an evening paper, to be called <i>The Job and
    Caviller</i>, are extremely interesting, but need to be

    <h2>BABLINGO.</h2>

    <p>It has been suggested to me that the time has come for a
    comprehensive investigation of the interesting language known
    as Bablingo. Materials for this are ready for use in every home
    that still possesses a nursery with an inmate not more than two
    years of age. I must premise that it is the inmate's mother and
    the inmate's nurse, not the actual inmate, who use the
    language. Some day, no doubt, there will arise an investigator
    who will reduce to order and catalogue the inchoate efforts of
    an infant to make itself understood by talking. These efforts
    are doubtless of high interest to the etymologist, but the
    difficulties of the task are at present too great, and in any
    case I am not the man to undertake it.</p>

    <p>I shall content myself for the moment with setting an
    examination paper in Bablingo for the purpose of testing
    knowledge. It will differ from most other examinations in
    having a further object&mdash;namely to supply instruction and
    information to the examiner. Later on it may be possible to
    construct a grammar, and to append to this a few easy
    exercises. It must be remembered, however, that there are great
    difficulties to be overcome in such a task. Every home, for
    instance, has its own rules for pronunciation. Of these I do
    not for my immediate purpose propose to take cognisance.</p>

    <p>Here, then, is a short Bablingo examination paper for the
    use of mothers and nurses. I do not at present see my way to
    including fathers.</p>

    <p>(1) On what principles is the language which you use in your
    nursery formed? Did you (<i>a</i>) acquire it, or (<i>b</i>)
    find yourself unconsciously in possession of it?</p>

    <p>(2) Give a list of the characteristic features which
    distinguish Bablingo from the dialects employed by Prehistoric
    Man.</p>

    <p>(3) What justification can you allege for the conversion of
    the words <i>little thing</i> into the words <i>ickle sing</i>?
    Are the spelling and pronunciation of these two words intended
    to be a concession to the feeble understanding of an
    infant?</p>

    <p>(4) <i>Wasums and didums, then? Was it a ickle birdie,
    then?</i> Expand the above into a four-line verse with rhymes,
    and explain why the language as spoken and written is nearly
    always in the past tense, and rarely in the present or
    future.</p>

    <p>(5)(<i>a</i>) <i>Did he woz-a-woz, then; a Mum's own
    woz-man?</i> (<i>b</i>) <i>'Oose queenie-mouse was 'oo?</i>
    Write a short story on one of the above texts.</p>

    <p>(6) <i>Did she try to hit her ickle bruzzer on his
    nosie-posie wiz a mug? She was a Tartar, and did she want to
    break him up into bitsy-witsies?</i> Construct a scene from a
    typical nursery drama on the above motive. What theories do you
    base on the extract with regard to the girl's temper and the
    boy's courage and endurance?</p>

    <h2>A YEAR'S REPRISALS.</h2>

    <p>When I sent Aunt Emily&mdash;from whom I have
    expectations&mdash;a pincushion at Christmas and she retaliated
    with a pen-wiper on New Year's Day, I thought that was the end
    of it.</p>

    <p>Not so.</p>

    <p>Aunt Emily reopened hostilities on my birthday with a purple
    satin letter-case embroidered with a sprig of rosemary and the
    word "Remembrance." That fresh offensive occurred on January
    27th, which, I repeat, is my birthday. Readers please note.</p>

    <p>When was Aunt Emily's birthday? Frenzied search in antique
    birthday books revealed not the horrid secret. Probing my diary
    for other suitable anniversaries, I came to February
    1st&mdash;"Partridge and Pheasant Shooting ends."</p>

    <p>I passed this as being inappropriate, and then&mdash;the
    very thing&mdash;February 14th, St. Valentine's. Also Full
    Moon.</p>

    <p>To arrive on that day, I despatched, carefully packed, the
    white marble clock from the spare-room. When well shaken it
    will tick for an hour. Aunt Emily had never seen it, I
    knew.</p>

    <p>Then I sounded the All Clear.</p>

    <p>But on Easter Eve a heavy packing-case was bumped onto my
    doorstep. From wrappings of sacking there emerged a large model
    of Eddystone lighthouse; a thermometer was embedded in its
    chest, minus the mercury, I noted. And Aunt Emily wished me as
    per enclosed card "A joyous Easter."</p>

    <p>With groans and lamentations another anniversary must be
    found by me. Ah! Here we have it! KING GEOKGE V. born June 3rd.
    On the dark roof of my spare-room wardrobe loomed an Indian
    vase&mdash;bright yellow with red blobs&mdash;very rare and
    very hideous, with a bulge in its middle. Obviously unique,
    because when the Indian made it his fellow-Indians slew him to
    prevent repetitions of the offence. I packed it in the middle
    of a crate and much straw, calculated to make an appalling mess
    when released.</p>

    <p>To dear Aunt Emily it went, with love, and a few topical
    remarks about the Monarchy.</p>

    <p>But Aunt Emily evidently had a diary too. On the 21st of
    October&mdash;anniversary of Trafalgar&mdash;my heart sank as
    the railway delivery van drew up at my door. The angry driver
    toiled into my passage with a packing-case (bristling with
    splinters and nails). When it was open and the chisel broken I
    picked the splinters out of my fingers and contemplated the
    battered horn of a gramophone emerging from sawdust and
    shavings.</p>

    <p>The mess created was indescribable when the horn was drawn
    forth. Shavings flew everywhere. The sawdust was like a
    butcher's shop. There were records too, some broken, all
    scratched. When set going it made a noise like a cockatoo with
    a cold. Decently covered with a cloth it was interned in the
    loft.</p>

    <p>Next please. One more effort and I should be one up and Aunt
    Emily to play. And her turn would be Christmas. Once she sent
    me five pounds at Christmas.</p>

    <p>The diary again. A poor hatch of anniversaries for November.
    A partial eclipse of the moon, partially visible at Greenwich,
    was down for the 22nd. But eclipses are too ominous.</p>

    <p>I fell back on KING EDWARD VII., born November 9th, 1841.
    Twenty-three volumes of Goodworthy's <i>History of England</i>
    should commemorate this. There had once been twenty-four, but
    the puppy ate one.</p>

    <p>Gratitude came by return of post, and I sat down in peace to
    await Christmas and a cheque.</p>

    <p>But on December 19th came another dreadful and splintery
    packing-case. Desperately I gouged it open. Out of it, through
    a cloud of shavings, emerged my own loathsome yellow-and-red
    Indian vase! No word with it&mdash;not a word, not a note. Not
    a funeral note.</p>

    <p>Rage overtook me. I disinterred Aunt Emily's own gramophone
    and records. I packed the horn anyhow. Such of the records as
    seemed difficult to get in I broke into small pieces and shoved
    in corners. I nailed the packing-case up with the same nails
    and addressed it in the boldest and fiercest of characters to
    Aunt Emily and caught the railway-van on the rebound. The deed
    was done.</p>

    <p>I laughed "Ha, ha!" I laughed "Ho, ho!" I would teach Aunt
    Emily to return me my own vase.</p>

    <p>Next morning came a letter. As I read it perspiration burst
    out on my forehead. Language the most awful burst from my
    lips.</p>

    <p>And yet it was a simple letter&mdash;from my little cousin
    Dolly.</p>

    <p>"DEAR BOB," it said,&mdash;"I sent you a yellow-and-red vase
    for Christmas. Your Aunt Emily gave it me as a wedding present.
    It is not my style and must be yours, because I have seen one
    like it in your house. Perhaps you collect them. Don't tell
    your Aunt, but I really couldn't bear it. I forgot to put any
    note in the box. Happy Christmas.</p>

    <p>"Love, DOLLY."</p>

    <p>And Aunt Emily would have opened my case by now.</p>

    <p>On Christmas Day I received a letter from her which I opened
    with cold and clammy fingers.</p>

    <p>She thanked me for sending back the gramophone. She was
    sorry I did not care for it. She was now sending it to a
    hospital for shell-shocked officers. And she wished me a Blithe
    Yuletide on a penny card. And she was very sincerely mine.</p>

    <p>Anyone can have her for aught I care.</p>

    <h2>A SOUTH SEA BUBBLE.</h2>

    <p>"I want you," said my hostess, "to take in Mrs. Blank. She
    is charming. All through the War she has been with her husband
    in the South Seas. London is a new place to her."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Blank did not look too promising. She was pretty in her
    way&mdash;"elegant" an American would have called her&mdash;but
    she lacked animation. However, the South Seas...! Anyone fresh
    from the Pacific must have enough to tell to see soup, fish and
    <i>entr&eacute;e</i> safely through.</p>

    <p>I began by remarking that she must find London a very
    complete change after the sun and placidity that she had come
    from.</p>

    <p>"It's certainly noisier," she said; "but we had our share of
    rain."</p>

    <p>"I thought it was always fine there," I remarked; but she
    laughed a denial and relapsed into silence.</p>

    <p>She was one of those women who don't take soup, and this
    made the economy of her utterances the more unfair.</p>

    <p>Racking my brain for a new start I fell back on those useful
    fellows, the authors. Presuming that anyone who had lived in
    that fascinating region&mdash;the promised land (if land is the
    word) of so many of us who are weary of English climatic
    treacheries&mdash;would be familiar with the literature of it.
    I went boldly to work.</p>

    <p>"The first book about the South Seas that I ever read," I
    said, "was BALLANTYNE'S <i>Coral Island</i>."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" she replied.</p>

    <p>I asked her if she too had not been brought up on
    BALLANTYNE, and she said no. She did not even know his
    name.</p>

    <p>"He wrote for boys," I explained rather lamely.</p>

    <p>"I read poetry chiefly as a girl," she said.</p>

    <p>"But surely you know STEVENSON'S <i>Island Nights'
    Entertainment</i>?" I said.</p>

    <p>No, she did not. Was it nice?</p>

    <p>"It's extraordinary," I said. "It gives you more of the
    atmosphere of the South Seas than any other work. And Louis
    BECKE&mdash;you must have read him?" I continued.</p>

    <p>No, she had not. She read very little. The last book she had
    read was on spiritualism.</p>

    <p>"Not even CONRAD?" I pursued. "No one has so described the
    calms and storms of the Pacific."</p>

    <p>No, she remembered no story called <i>Conrad</i>.</p>

    <p>I was about to explain that CONRAD was the writer, not the
    written; but it seemed a waste of words, and we fell into a
    stillness broken only by the sound of knife and fork.</p>

    <p>"Hang it! you shall talk," I said to myself; and then aloud,
    "Tell me all about copra. I have longed to know what copra is;
    how it grows, what it looks like, what it is for."</p>

    <p>"You have come to the wrong person," she replied, with wide
    eyes. "I never heard of it. Or did you say 'cobra'? Of course I
    know what a cobra is&mdash;it's a snake. I've seen them at the
    Zoo."</p>

    <p>I put her right. "Copra, the stuff that the traders in the
    South Seas deal in."</p>

    <p>"I never heard of it," she said. "But then why should I? I
    know nothing about the South Seas."</p>

    <p>My stock fell thirty points and I crumbled bread nervously,
    hoping for something sensible to say; but at this moment
    "half-time" mercifully set in. My partner on the other side
    turned to me suavely and asked if I thought the verses in
    <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> were a beauty or a blemish; and with the
    assistance of the London stage, the flight to America, Mrs.
    FULTON'S <i>Blight</i>, Mr. WALPOLE'S <i>Secret City</i> and
    the prospects of the new Academy, I sailed serenely into port.
    She was as easy and agreeable a woman as that other was
    difficult, and before she left for the drawing-room she had
    invited me to lunch and I had accepted.</p>

    <p>As I said Good-night to my hostess I asked why she had told
    me that my first partner had been in the South Seas. She said
    that she had said nothing of the sort; what she had said was
    that during the War she had been stationed with her husband,
    Colonel Blank, at Southsea.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>THE MESSAGE OF HULL.</h2>

    <p>The Hull Election has been keenly discussed in various
    papers, but by none with more enthusiasm than <i>The Daily
    News</i>. In a special article from the luminous pen of
    "A.G.G.," in the issue of April 12th, the true inwardness of
    the portent is thus revealed:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The message of Hull is a message for all the world. It is
    the announcement that this country, whatever its Government may
    do, will not have a French peace. It is a declaration to
    America that the English people are with her in her
    determination to have a League of Nations' settlement and no
    other. It is the repudiation of Conscription, of war on Russia,
    of the permanent military occupation of Germany, of imperialism
    and grab, of war policy in Ireland, of repression in Egypt, of
    the reckless profligacy and corruption that are plunging Europe
    into Bolshevism and hurrying this country to irretrievable
    ruin."</p>

    <p>We confess that we are staggered by the moderation, not to
    say modesty, of "A.G.G." as an interpreter of the meaning of
    the Hull Election. He has omitted infinitely more than he has
    inscribed in his list.</p>

    <p>The return of Commander KENWORTHY stands, of course, for all
    these things, but for many others of at least equal
    importance.</p>

    <p>It means the disappearance of influenza, the ravages of
    which are clearly traceable to the political virus disseminated
    by the Coalition.</p>

    <p>It means the rehabilitation of Mr. BIRRELL and his return to
    public life as English Ambassador to the Court of King Valeroso
    I.</p>

    <p>It foreshadows the wholesale gratuitous distribution of
    cigarettes, marmalade and gramophones.</p>

    <p>It means the prohibition of the use of the French horn in
    orchestras and all places where they play, the reinstatement of
    the German flute and the restoration of the German Fleet.</p>

    <p>Lastly, it means the compulsory prohibition of all Greek
    except "Alpha of the Plough."</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The latest of the now so fashionable short-story volumes to
    come my way is one called <i>Our Casualty, Etc.</i>
    (SKEFFINGTON). Much virtue in that "<i>Etc.</i>," which covers
    other fifteen little tales in the best, or nearly the best,
    "Birmingham" manner. I say "nearly," because for its happiest
    expression the art of "Mr. GEORGE BIRMINGHAM" demands space to
    tangle events into more complicated confusion than can be
    contrived in the dozen pages of these episodes. But within
    their limitations they are all excellent fun, partly concerned
    with the War (usually with an Irishman involved), partly
    recalled from the piping and whisky-drinking times of peace, at
    Inishmore and elsewhere. One can only treat them after the
    manner of the schoolboy who declined to distinguish between the
    Major and Minor Prophets. But I rather specially enjoyed the
    title-piece, which tells how the super-patriotism of an aged
    volunteer defeated the kindly plans of those who would have
    saved him fatigue by assigning to him the r&ocirc;le of
    casualty in a trench-relief practice. Casualties also figure in
    "Getting Even," an improbable but highly entertaining fiction
    of the score practised by an ingenious Medical Officer (Irish,
    I need hardly say) upon an over-zealous C.O., who, to keep him
    busy during a field day, flooded his "clearing station" with
    all sorts of complicated imaginary cases, only to find the
    fictitious victims arranged comfortably in rows under the shade
    of the trees to await the Padre and a burying party, the M.O.
    reporting that they had all died before reaching him. It
    couldn't possibly happen as here told, but that matters little,
    since, so far as I am concerned, a "Birmingham" tale can always
    well afford to dispense with credibility.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I am distinctly grateful to ROSE MACAULAY for <i>What
    Not</i> (CONSTABLE). It brought me the pleasantest end to
    anything but a perfect English Spring day. She has wit, not so
    common a gift that you can afford just to take it for granted;
    she knows when to stop, selecting not exhausting; and she makes
    her epigrams by the way, as it were, without exposing the
    process of manufacture. (Other epigrammatists please copy.)
    Miss MACAULAY'S "prophetic comedy" is a joyous rag of
    Government office routine, flappery, Pelmania, Tribunals, State
    advertising, the Lower Journalism and "What Not." That
    audacious eugenist, <i>Nicky Chester</i>, first Minister of
    Brains in the post-war period of official attempts to raise the
    nation from C3 to something nearer A1 on the intellectual
    plane, happens, because of his family history, to be
    uncertified for marriage. He also happens to fall very
    desperately in love with his secretary, <i>Kitty Grammont</i>,
    and the conflict between duty and desire becomes the
    theme&mdash;perhaps just a little too heavy&mdash;of an
    extravaganza that is happiest in its lighter and more
    irreverent moments. Which is to say that <i>What Not</i>
    wanders out of the key. But what on earth does that matter if
    one is made to laugh quite often and to smile almost
    continuously at a very shrewd piece of observation,
    whimsicality and tempered malice? And you will like the serene
    <i>Pansy Ponsonby</i> (out of "Hullo, Peace!"), who could
    scarcely be called <i>Kitty's</i> "sister-in-law," but was of
    the most faithful. The odd thing is that under all her gibing
    the author seems to have a queer furtive admiration for her
    precious Ministry of Brains.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Among the many things I like in DORETHEA CONYERS' novels is
    the artistic subtlety, achieved by few of our other novelists,
    with which she manages to write them as it were in character. I
    am quite sure that if <i>Berenice Ermyntrude Nicosia Nevin</i>,
    who is called by her initials on the cover and inside by what
    they spell, had tried to write a novel it would have been
    remarkably like <i>B.E.N.</i> (METHUEN). There would have been
    the same keen delight in horses, hunting and Irish scenery, and
    the same cheerful disregard for such trifles as spelling or
    such conventions as making quite sure that your reader knows
    which character <span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"
       id="page332"></a>[pg 332]</span> is speaking at any given
       moment, and the same excellent humour, which, if it is at
       the expense of the Irish, is kindly enough for all that. It
       seems to me that in her new novel Mrs. CONYERS, wisely
       refusing to stray to that suburbia in which her gifts lack
       this charm, has recaptured much of the careless rapture of
       her earliest books; and very careless and very rapturous
       they wore. But I am not quite sure that in real life even
       <i>Ben</i>, when as second whip to the East Cara hounds she
       lost her horse, would have found an aeroplane useful to
       catch up with. In case it should be objected that anything
       so funny as the tea at <i>Miss Talty's</i> never could
       happen, even in the Caher Valley district, I want to put it
       on record here and now that it could and does.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Mystery Keepers</i> (LANE), by MARION FOX, reminds me
    of the old riddle, "What is it that has feathers and two legs,
    and barks like a dog?"&mdash;the answer being a stork. People
    who protest that a stork doesn't bark like a dog are told that
    that part is put in to make it harder. I find that the greater
    part of the mystery kept by <i>The Mystery Keepers</i> is put
    in to make it harder. The Abbey at Clynch St. Mary has a
    "coise" put on it by the last Abbess, and every direct male
    heir expires punctually on his twenty-first birthday. The
    actual agency is a poisoned ring concealed in the frame of a
    portrait of the malevolent Abbess and is in the custody of the
    <i>Otway</i> family, who enjoy a prescriptive if nebulous right
    to be stewards of the property. Just how or why the
    <i>Otways</i>&mdash;noble fellows, we are given to
    understand&mdash;carry out the deceased Abbess's nefarious
    wishes with such precision and despatch is not explained.
    Anyway the mother of the last victim, who has found out the
    secret, steals the ring, murders the <i>Otway</i> of the
    period, and retires to a lunatic asylum after her son has
    himself stolen the ring from her workbox and poisoned himself
    into the next world. That finishes it. The ring retires to a
    museum and the proper people marry each other. It is a slender
    and quite impossible story, but told in a clever way which goes
    far to redeem its lack of substance.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Graftons</i> (COLLINS) is a sequel to Mr. ARCHIBALD
    MARSHALL'S former chronicle of the same pleasant family. Herein
    you shall find them, pursuing the even tenor of their
    prosperous way, father, son and charming daughters, and
    arriving placidly at the point where, in the natural sequence
    of events, these daughters leave the paternal nest for others
    provided by eligible mates. Their courtships, and some mild
    uncertainty as to whether papa <i>Grafton</i>, well-preserved
    and wealthy widower, will or will not follow the example of his
    female offspring, provide the entire matter of the book. For
    the rest Mr. MARSHALL is content to mark time (and very
    pleasantly) with pictures of English country life at its most
    comfortable, and in particular with some comedy scenes,
    excellently done, turning upon the often delicate relationship
    of Hall and Parsonage. There are a couple of clerical portraits
    in the book that seem to me as lifelike as anything of the kind
    since <i>Barchester</i>. Apart from this the outstanding virtue
    of the <i>Graftons</i> is the reality of their dialogue.
    Precisely thus do, or did, actual people speak in the quiet old
    times before the War; precisely thus also did nothing whatever
    of any consequence happen to the vast majority of them. Since,
    however, the truth and charm of the tale depend upon this
    absence of the sensational, I must the more regret that Messrs.
    COLLINS, who have printed it exquisitely, should have been
    betrayed into a coloured wrapper of almost grotesque
    ineptitude.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In <i>Graduation</i> (CHATTO AND WINDUS) there is an
    essential femininity about Miss IRENE RUTHERFORD McLEOD'S style
    and general attitude that imposes limitations; it is a quality
    that shows itself not only in her plot, but in her characters,
    the three reputed males who figure therein being as fine
    examples of true womanliness as you need wish to meet.
    <i>Frieda</i> was the heroine (a name somehow significant); and
    of the trouser-wearers, the first, <i>Geoffrey</i>, was a
    cat-like deceiver, who fascinated poor <i>Frieda</i> for ends
    unspecified, pretended (the minx!) to be keen on the Suffrage
    movement, which he wasn't, and concealed a wife; the second was
    a Being too perfect to endure beyond Chapter 10, where he
    expires eloquently of heart-failure, leaving <i>Alan</i>, the
    third, to bear the white man's burden and clasp <i>Frieda</i>
    to his maidenly heart. This sentimental progress is, I suppose,
    what is implied by the title and the symbolic staircase (if it
    <i>is</i> a staircase?) on the wrapper. But my trouble was that
    I could never discern in the sweet girl-graduate any
    development of character from the pretentious futility of her
    earliest appearance. Perhaps I am prejudiced. Undeniably Miss
    McLEOD can draw a certain type of prig with a horrible
    facility. But the antiquated modernity of her scheme, flooded
    as it is with the New Dawn of, say, a decade ago, and its bland
    disregard of everything that has happened since, ended by
    violently irritating me. Others may have better luck.</p>

    <p>Spring has been slow in coming, but I got something more
    than a whiff of actual summer when <i>Under Blue Skies</i>
    (HUTCHINSON) came my way. Mr. DE VERD STACPOOLE is at the top
    of his form, and it is a real pleasure to recommend an author
    who brings to his tales of adventure so nice a sense of style
    and so keen a feeling for character. In "The Frigate Bird" the
    rapscallions who seize a schooner and, without any knowledge of
    navigation, sail the high seas, are full-blooded adventurers;
    but there is all the difference in the world between the
    character of the educated <i>Carlyon</i> and that of the
    simple-minded and ignorant <i>Finn</i>. This yarn occupies
    nearly half of the book, and the other stories should give food
    for thought to those who allege that no Englishman can write a
    short story. Apart from one charming little tale of a haunted
    French <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> Mr. STACPOOLE allows us to bask
    here in the eternal summer of Pacific skies. I am very grateful
    for my sun-bath.</p>

    <p>In <i>Poems of the Great War</i>, by Mrs. ROBERTSON-GLASGOW,
    readers of <i>Punch</i> will recognise some of the best serious
    poems that have appeared in these pages of recent years. The
    little half-crown volume in which they reappear has been
    admirably printed at S. Aldhelm's Home for Boys, Frome, and may
    be bought at SMITH'S in Kensington High Street.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
